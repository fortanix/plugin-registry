#AWS Plugin for Secret Management with Fortanix DSM

#Introduction: 
This page provides an overview of a newly developed AWS plugin that leverages Fortanix Data Security Manager (DSM) for secure secret management within your AWS environment.

#Challenges of Managing Secrets in AWS:
    Security Risks: Secrets are highly sensitive data and storing them unencrypted or in plaintext poses significant security vulnerabilities. Accidental exposure, breaches, and insider threats can have devastating consequences.
    Manual Processes: Manually rotating, managing, and granting access to secrets is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. This slows down workflows and increases the risk of human error.
    Lack of Centralized Control: Secrets often spread across different services and accounts, making it difficult to track, audit, and enforce consistent security policies.
    Compliance Complexity: Meeting compliance regulations requires stringent controls over secrets, which can be challenging with decentralized management.

Features
    Secure creation, rotation, and deletion of secrets
    Access control and granular permission management
    Integration with existing AWS services and IAM roles
    Audit logging and compliance reporting
    User-friendly interface for managing secrets

secret_id: The identifier for the secret whose details are to be listed.

Sample JSON:

{
  "operation": "list",
  "secret_id": "55ec7250-ffd1-4db7-8e5d-"
}


4. List Versions: Description: Lists all versions of a specified secret, providing a history of changes and the ability to access previous values of the secret. This operation supports auditing and compliance by enabling tracking of secret updates over time.
